              <h3>Flute</h3>
              <p>I have experience in playing the flute for around 5 years now. I have played in school bands and with
                  other instruments, but I primarily play on my own time by myself. I have also started to look into playing the
                  bamboo flute, which I enjoy the sound of.</p>

              <h3>Python</h3>
              <p>Learned Python programming for over a year. I have made a number of small projects, from games
                    to productivity applications. I am on the 100 Days of Code course on Udemy, and this website is
                    practice for web development.</p>
